## ðŸ“Š Churn Analysis Project ðŸš€

This project analyzes customer churn using **BigQuery, dbt, and Looker Studio**.

In this project, I analyzed customer churn for a bank using BigQuery, dbt, and Looker Studio. The goal was to identify patterns in customer behavior and find actionable strategies to reduce churn and increase profitability. The dataset included customer age, geography, balance, activity status, and churn status, which I used to build data models and visualizations.

My analysis showed that inactive customers churn at a much higher rate than active ones, and low-balance customers are more likely to leave. Additionally, churn rates vary by geography and age, with younger customers showing a higher tendency to leave. These insights suggest that the bank can increase retention by offering re-engagement campaigns, personalized financial products, and region-specific marketing strategies.

By acting on these findings, the bank can reduce customer loss, increase lifetime value, and drive more revenue. The Looker Studio dashboard provides a real-time view of churn trends, allowing for data-driven decisions to improve customer loyalty and overall profitability.
